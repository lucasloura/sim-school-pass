# SIM School Pass System

  SIM School Pass System is a project developed by me, @Martinelii and @adryellen11santana as college assignment during February-April of 2023. The proposal of the assignment was to apply the concepts of the Project-Based Learning Methodology learned during the English IV classes, using any language and/or platform, to propose a solution to a real world problem.
<!--  We chose to focus on the SIM School Pass enroll & re-enroll system as it is a student's right and we believe that simplifying/facilitating this process in order to make it more pratical will leave a positive affect on the community, as well as we having plenty of experience with it as it is part of our daily lives. -->

<!--  We believe the SIM (Sistema Integrado MauÃ¡) School Pass system works just fine and helps the community a lot, it is in it's enroll/re-enroll system that we found some issues such as the lack of clarity about the requirements for obtaining the pass as well as the necessary documents, the form to be filled and the pass' regulamentation being hosted on different websites, and the overall lack of computerization of the process. -->
  Our intention with this project is to show how we think some issues that we found in the SIM School Pass enroll/re-enroll system could be solved through the use of script programming.

  Developing this project was quite fun and interesting, as the PBL Methodology incentives us to look around ourselves to find a real world problem and then brainstorm possible solutions to it based on what we can do.
